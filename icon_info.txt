ICON REQUIREMENTS FOR CHROME EXTENSION

The extension requires three icon files in PNG format:

1. icon16.png - 16x16 pixels
2. icon48.png - 48x48 pixels  
3. icon128.png - 128x128 pixels

You can create these icons using any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Canva, etc.) or use online icon generators.

SUGGESTED ICON DESIGN:
- Simple, recognizable symbol related to pricing/analysis
- Examples: dollar sign ($), magnifying glass, calculator, chart
- Use contrasting colors for visibility
- Keep design simple as icons will be small

ALTERNATIVE: Use a free icon from sites like:
- Flaticon.com
- Icons8.com
- Feathericons.com
- Material Design Icons

Once you have the icons:
1. Save them with the exact names above
2. Place them in the same folder as your other extension files
3. The extension will automatically use them

Note: If you don't have icons ready, the extension will still work but may show a default Chrome extension icon.
