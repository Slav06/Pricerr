ICON DESIGN FOR CHROME EXTENSION

You need to create 3 icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels) 
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

Suggested design:
- Background: Purple gradient (#6b46c1 to #805ad5)
- Icon: White document/page symbol with a magnifying glass
- Text: "JE" (Job Extractor) in white

You can create these using:
1. Online tools like Canva, Figma, or GIMP
2. AI image generators like DALL-E or Midjourney
3. Professional designers

Or use a simple placeholder for now and update later.

For Chrome Web Store submission, icons are required.
